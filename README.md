These files are to satisfy assignment requirements from 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course Week 4. Instructions are to take the data set described below and complete the following tasks:
  
  1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

__Running information:__

Script will automatically acquire the necessary packages and data. If the download fails, the script will also work if the downloaded .zip folder from the link above is pre-exctracted into the working directory.

Packages may not install under certain network conditions. If packages do not install, manually install 'dplyr', 'readr', and 'stringr' packages.

If available memory is a concern, search #memoryManagement and uncomment rm() functions to increase memory availability during processing

Script will generate warnings that do not impact current script function. Specifically, some column names will be automatically re-named to avoid duplicates. None of the columns affected are targeted by this analysis.
__Input files:__
  - 'features.txt': List of all features (column names).
  - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name (activity lookup table).
  - 'train/X_train.txt': Training set (dataset).
  - 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels (activiy values).
  - 'test/X_test.txt': Test set (dataset).
  - 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels (activity values).
  - 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30 (subject IDs). 
  - 'test/subject_test.txt': as in subject_train but pairs with test data (subject IDs).

__Output:__
  - 'HAR_summary.txt': Mean and standard deviation measurements averaged by 'subject' & 'activity'
  - (optional, marked as comment)'HAR_means-std.txt': Original mean and standard deviation measurements 

__Procedure Summary__
1. Check for source data in working directory
1. Check for necessary packages
1. Load features from file 
1. Load subjects from file and stack
1. Load measurements from file with features as column names and stack in the same order as subjects (satisfies Rquirement #3)
1. Append subjects to measurements (satisfies Requirement #1)
1. Select only columns reporting mean() or std() (satisfies Requirement #2)
1. Clean parenthesis
1. Load train and test Y values as activities and stack in same order as measurements and append to dataset
1. Assymetrically join measurements and activity lookup based on activity codes (satisfies Requirement #4)
1. Group measurements by activity and subject
1. Calculate averages by groups (satisfies Requirement #5)
1. Write output files to working directory
